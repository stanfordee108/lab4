Q: Should "note_done", "load_new_note", "generate_next_sample", and "new_sample_ready" be one pulses or set high?
    
A: One pulses
    
Q: I see a timing violation in the codec ("adau1761_codec_codec_clock_gen_clkout0"); is this something I need to fix?
    
A: Nope, this is a bug in the starter code we've sourced for the class but shouldn't effect your final product.
    
Q: I see a timing violation that's not in the codec ("clk_100"); is this something I need to fix?
    
A: Yes, this is something you need to fix.
